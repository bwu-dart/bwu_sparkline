### Status

#### some things are already working:
 
* Bar chart
* Line chart
* Tooltip

The other chart types are not yet implemented.
This package is in very early state. I ported it because I want to use it in a BWU Datagrid example.

If you find a bug please create an issue.
I plan to improve this package but currently BWU datagrid has higher priority.
